# Pre-work - **Tippo**

**Tippo** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Lu Liu üôãüèª**

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Custom font
* [x] UI animations (a simple and subtle fade-in for trying out the nested view feature a bit)
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

When I added an action, Xcode automatically generated arg types as "Any" instead of "AnyObject" demo-ed in the video, so when I tried to link the Value Changed event of the Segmented Control back to my calculateTip() function, there was only "insert action" but no "connect action" triggered.
